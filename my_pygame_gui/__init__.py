"""Pygame GUI Package

Package Description
==================
This package contains classes and components for a GUI framework in pygame. Simply
have a class inherit from the Gui class in gui and start from there. This package is still
in a very early stage and there was not enough time before the deadline to make it ready
for use in the final project, so for submission purposes, we switched to an existing GUI
package.
