"""CovSim Sim Package: Sim Manager

Module Description
==================
This module contains the overhead manager class to run the simulation, along with two
dataclasses representing graphical data output from the simulation, as well as the
simulation input parameters to configure the sim.

        - block_dim: the width and height of a city block
        - buildings_constant: An arbitrary value which influences the final number of buildings in the city, the higher
        it is, the more buildings
        - road_width: Space between city blocks. Local spacing within each block is derived from this value
        - high_rise_percentage: The chance for each building to have 5+ floors
        - residential_ratio, commercial_ratio, industrial_ratio: summed up and converted into proportions. After
        subtracting the travel and medical buildings, the remaining buildings split by these proportions.
        - avg_age: The average age of the population
        - mask_wearing_percentage: Each person has their own percentage for mask wearing, which determines how often
        they wear a mask. This value indicates what the average mask_wearing_percentage value should be (% 0-100)
        - average_travels_per_year: How many travels does a person make on average per year, used to randomize
        when a person decides to travel
        - is_closed_border: Prevents travel entirely
        - initial_vaccination_percentage: (% 0-100) how many people are initially vaccinated
        - initial_infection_percentage: (% 0-100) how many people are initially infected
        - is_vaccine_available: further vaccination impossible without vaccine
        - homelessness_percentage: how many people are homeless
