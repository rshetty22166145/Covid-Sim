"""App Simulation Communication Module

Module Description
==================
This module contains the class in charge of spawning a second process to run
the simulation. It takes care of receiving and sending messages between the
main and simulation process via a pipe and an alternate thread. This module
is not used in the final project as we did not find time to extensively
test this multiprocessing. In the future, the graphics rendering will be
decoupled from the simulation processing to prevent the graphics from slowing
down the simulation.
